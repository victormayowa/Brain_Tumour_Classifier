Here's what my MVP should include:

User Interface (UI):

A clean and intuitive user interface where users can interact with the application.
Upload functionality for users to submit their MRI images for classification.
Backend Processing:

Integration with your trained brain tumor classification model.
Code to process the uploaded MRI image, make predictions, and return the classification result.
Classification Result Display:

Display the classification result to the user, indicating whether a tumor is detected or not.
Feedback or Report:

Provide a simple report or feedback message to explain the classification result to the user.
Basic Error Handling:

Implement basic error handling for scenarios like incorrect file format, file size limits, or unexpected errors during processing.
Deployment:

Host the web application on a platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, etc.) to make it accessible online.
Documentation:

Provide basic documentation on how to use the web app, including instructions for uploading images and interpreting results.





For your Minimum Viable Product (MVP) in the "MRI BRAIN TUMOUR AI CLASSIFIER" project, consider the following functionalities:

1. **Basic Image Classification:**
   - Implement a functioning model capable of classifying MRI images into different categories (e.g., tumor vs. non-tumor).

2. **User Interface (UI):**
   - Create a simple web-based interface or GUI for users to upload MRI images for classification.

3. **Prediction Display:**
   - Provide a result page showing the prediction label along with a confidence score.

4. **Feedback Mechanism:**
   - Allow users to provide feedback on the accuracy of the classification. This can be used for future model improvements.

5. **Model Training Pipeline:**
   - Set up a system to periodically retrain the model with new data for continuous improvement.

6. **Data Privacy and Security:**
   - Implement measures to ensure patient data privacy and comply with healthcare data regulations.

7. **Documentation and Help Section:**
   - Include user guides and FAQs to assist users in understanding how to use the system effectively.

8. **Error Handling and Validation:**
   - Implement proper error handling and input validation to ensure the system provides accurate results.

Remember, the MVP should focus on delivering a functional system that demonstrates the core functionality of the project. It may not include all the advanced features or optimizations that could be added later. Once the MVP is in place and validated, you can iteratively add more features and enhancements based on user feedback and project goals.
